        <div class="hide"><h2> The idea of computers as automated devices was born less than 100 years ago, and it changed a lot since then. Few people have contributed as much as Alan Turing, inventor of theoretical computation, and Tim Bernes-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web. While some of their ideas predicted our current days, some of them might’ve not aged
well - although it is undeniable how they have impacted our lifes, anyway.</h2></div>

  </div>
  <div id="text3">
      <p><span style="color: coral">——</span> “As Lanier told Kulwin in the full interview: <span class="span31">“We run everything.</span><img class="img3" src ="imagens/img3.jpeg"> We are the conduit of everything else happening in the world. We’ve disrupted absolutely everything. Politics, finance, education, media, relationships—family relationships, romantic relationships—we’ve put ourselves in the middle of everything, we’ve absolutely won.” The problem, though, is that <span class="span31">“we” don’t act as if “we” have won—“we” refuse to take responsibility for “our” actions </span><img class="img3" src ="imagens/img3.jpeg">because, in “our” view, “we” are still idealistic underdogs." </p> 
 <br>
      <p><span style="color: blueviolet">——</span> “In fact, artificial intelligence as we know it depends entirely on a <span class="span32">much wider set of political and social structures.</span><img class="img3" src ="imagens/img3.jpeg"> And due to the capital required to build AI at scale and the ways of seeing that it optimizes AI systems are ultimately designed to serve existing dominant interests. <span class="span31">In this sense, artificial intelligence is a registry of power.” </span><img class="img3" src ="imagens/img3.jpeg"></p>
 <br>
      <p><span style="color: blueviolet">——</span> “To understand how AI is fundamentally political, we need to go beyond neural nets and statistical pattern recognition to instead ask <span class="span32">what is being optimized, and for whom, and who gets to decide.” </span><img class="img3" src ="imagens/img3.jpeg"></p>
 </div>
      <div id="text4">
          <p><span style="color: coral">——</span> “By tracking user clicks and mouseovers, advertisers could “measure” engagement, and thus overcome what social theorist Jean Baudrillard had presciently and perversely called the <span class="span41">“silent power of the majority.” </span><img class="img4" src ="imagens/img4.jpeg">To optimize performance, platforms encouraged advertisers to amalgamate related but bespoke microaudiences, that is, to create a <span class="span41">crowd of users </span><img class="img4" src ="imagens/img4.jpeg">by consolidating rhyming groups.”</p>
<br>
      <p><span style="color: blueviolet">——</span> “Soon, the actual product no longer mattered, for monetized <span class="span42">user clicks generated their own wealth: outrage—or anything that piqued curiosity—had become profitable.</span><img class="img4" src ="imagens/img4.jpeg"> Most infamously, hackers from Moldova produced right- and left-wing fake political news during the <span class="span42">2016 U.S elections</span><img class="img4" src ="imagens/img4.jpeg"> in order to profit from a combination of Facebook click throughs and Google ad auctions.” </p>

        <p><span style="color: coral">——</span> "So . . . if these algorithms do not include race as a category, how can they be racist? Most obviously, these programs may not explicitly use racial categories, but they do so implicitly through their <span class="span51">use of proxies, such as zip codes.”</span></p>
<br>
        <p><span style="color: coral">——</span> "The problem stems from the libraries on which these algorithms have been traditionally trained: the “ground truth” for these programs are <span class="span51">the faces of Hollywood celebrities and university undergraduates,</span> those well-known hotspots of diversity. At a fundamental level, this “curation” means<span class="span51"> that ground truth = deep fake.”</span></p>
 <br>
      <p><span style="color: blueviolet">——</span> “By looking at how classifications are made, we see how technical schemas enforce 
          <span class="span52">hierarchies and magnify inequity. </span>Machine learning presents us with a regime of normative reasoning that, when in the ascendant, takes shape as a powerful <span class="span52">governing rationality.”</span> </p>
<br>
        <p><span style="color: blueviolet">——</span> “There are gigantic datasets full of people’s selfies, of hand gestures, of people driving cars, of babies crying, of newsgroup conversations from the 1990s, all to <span class="span52">improve algorithms</span> that perform such functions as facial recognition, language prediction, and object detection. When these collections of data are no longer seen as people’s personal material but <span class="span52">merely as infrastructure, the specific meaning or context of an image or a video is assumed to be irrelevant.” </span></p>
    </div>
    <div id="text6">
         <p><span style="color: hotpink">——</span> "This special property of digital computers, that they can mimic any discrete state machine, is described by saying that <span class="span61">they are universal machines.</span> <img class="img6" src ="imagens/img6.jpeg">The existence of machines with this property has the important consequence that, considerations of speed apart, it is <span class="span61">unnecessary to design various new machines to do various computing processes.</span><img class="img6" src ="imagens/img6.jpeg"> They can all be done with one digital computer, suitably programmed for each case. It will be seen that as a consequence of this all digital computers are in a sense equivalent.”</p>
<br>
        <p><span style="color: greenyellow">——</span> "Whatever type of server, the user interface is the same, so <span class="span62">users do not need to understand the differences between the many protocols in common use. </span><img class="img6" src ="imagens/img6.jpeg">Before W3, access to networked information typically involved knowledge of many different access “recipes” for different systems, and a different command language for each."</p>
<br>
        <p><span style="color: greenyellow">——</span> "The Web was designed so that if it was used independently for two projects, and <span class="span62">later relationships were found between the projects, </span><img class="img6" src ="imagens/img6.jpeg">then no major or centralized changes would have to be made, but the information could smoothly reshape to represent the new state of knowledge. This <span class="span62">property of scaling </span><img class="img6" src ="imagens/img6.jpeg">has allowed the Web to expand rapidly from its origins at CERN across the Internet irrespective of boundaries of nations or disciplines."</p>
    </div>
    <div id="text7">
        <p><span style="color: hotpink">——</span> "We have mentioned that the <span class="span71">“book of rules”</span><img class="img7" src ="imagens/img7.jpeg"> supplied to the computer is replaced in the machine by a part of the store. It is then called the “table of instructions.” It is the duty of the control to see that these instructions are<span class="span71"> obeyed correctly and in the right order.”</span><img class="img7" src ="imagens/img7.jpeg"></p>
<br>
        <p><span style="color: hotpink">——</span> "Instructions of these latter types are very important because they make it possible for a sequence of operations to be <span class="span71">repeated over and over again until some condition is fulfilled,</span><img class="img7" src ="imagens/img7.jpeg"> but in doing so to obey, not fresh instructions on each repetition, but the same ones over and over again.”</p>
<br>
        <p><span style="color: greenyellow">——</span> "When it starts, it displays an object, normally a document with text and possibly images. Some of the phrases and images are highlighted: in blue, or boxed, or perhaps numbered, depending on what sort of a display you have and <span class="span72">how your preferences have been set.</span> <img class="img7" src ="imagens/img7.jpeg">Clicking the mouse on the highlighted area (“anchor”) causes the client program to retrieve another object from some other computer, a “server.” The retrieved object is normally also in a <span class="span72">hypertext format,</span><img class="img7" src ="imagens/img7.jpeg"> so the process of navigation continues.

    <div id="text8">
        <p><span style="color: hotpink">——</span> "Most actual digital computers have only a finite store. There is no theoretical difficulty in the idea of a computer with an unlimited store. Of course only a finite part can have been used at any one time. Likewise only a finite amount can have been constructed, <span style="color: hotpink">but we can imagine more and more being added as required. 
        ”</span></p>
    <br>
        <p><span style="color: hotpink">——</span> "I believe that in about fifty years’ time it will be possible to programme computers with 
        a <span style="color: hotpink">storage capacity of about 109</span> to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 per cent. chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning. The original question, “Can machines think?” <span style="color: hotpink">I believe to be too meaningless to deserve discussion.”</span></p>
    <br>
        <p><span style="color: greenyellow">——</span> "While gopher space is in fact a web containing many loops, the menu system gives the user the impression of a tree. The Veronica server provides a <span style="color: greenyellow">master index</span> for gopher space. The W3 data model is similar to the gopher model, except that menus are generalized to hypertext documents. In both cases, simple file servers generate the menus or hypertext directly from the file structure of a server. The W3 hypertext model gives the program <span style="color: greenyellow">more power to communicate the options available to the reader, </span>as it can include headings and <span style="color: greenyellow">various forms of list structure, </span>for example, within the hypertext.

    <div id="text9">
        <p><span style="color: hotpink">——</span> "The explanation of the paradox (about the idea of a learning machine) is that the rules which get changed in the learning process are of a <span style="color: hotpink">rather less pretentious kind,</span> claiming only an <span style="color: hotpink">ephemeral validity.</span> The reader may draw a parallel with the Constitution of the United States.”</p>
<br>
        <p><span style="color: hotpink">——</span> <span style="color: hotpink">"The “skin of an onion” </span>analogy is also helpful. In considering the functions of the mind or the brain we find certain operations which we can explain in purely mechanical terms. This we say does not correspond to the real mind: it is a sort of skin which we must strip off if we are to find the real mind. But then in what remains we find<span style="color: hotpink"> a further skin to be stripped off, and so on.”</span></p>
<br>
        <p><span style="color: greenyellow">——</span> "To achieve this, the client sends <span style="color: greenyellow">a (weighted) list of the formats it can handle,</span> and the server replies with data in any of those formats that it can produce. This allows proprietary formats to be used between <span style="color:greenyellow">consenting programs in private, without the need for standardization of those formats.</span> This is important both for high-end users who share data in sophisticated forms, and also as a hook for <span style="color: greenyellow">formats that have yet to be invented."</span></p>

    <div id="text10">
        <p><span style="color: hotpink">——</span> "We may hope that machines will eventually compete with men in all purely intellectual fields. But which are the best ones to start with? Even this is a difficult decision. Many people think that a very abstract activity, <span style="color: hotpink">like the playing of chess </span>would be best. It can also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English. <span style="color: hotpink">This process could follow the normal teaching of a child."</span></p>
<br>
        <p><span style="color: greenyellow">——</span> "The Web does not yet meet its design goal as <span style="color: greenyellow">being a pool of knowledge </span>that is as easy to update as to read. That level of immediacy of knowledge sharing waits for easy-to-use hypertext editors to be <span style="color: greenyellow">generally available on most platforms.</span> Most information has in fact passed through publishers or system managers of one sort or another."</p>
